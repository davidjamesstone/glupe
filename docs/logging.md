# Logging

The [good](https://github.com/hapijs/good) plugin is used to bring a flexible logging solution to your application.

The [good-file](https://github.com/hapijs/good-file) and [good-console](https://github.com/hapijs/good-console) packages are also included.

The logging configuration can be found in the `config` directory in the root of the application. See [Config.md](config.md) for more information.
